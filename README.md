# Data-analysis-on-EEG-investigations-of-human-touch
This repository contains data analysis structures for EEG recordings of human touch. Python 2.7 has been used.

ABSTRACT
The investigations on this project aim to analyse Electroencephalographic (EEG) data regarding human touch. A study of the neural correlates of attention to touch was carried out about some experiments based on a variation of the Posnerâ€™s cue-target paradigm, with the aim of clarifying the nature of relation between endogenous and exogenous attention. The design and development of a data structure which allows the organised execution of multiple test was carried out. This granted the implementation of several analysis tools, such as frequency and time analysis, comparing measuring locations and experimental conditions. Laterality studies to check the relative contribution of the two hemispheres in different stages of the experiments and conditions were alse performed. Finally, a multi-class classification algorithm based on state of the art machine learning tools was implemented to predict experimental condition on recorded data. 

STUDY 1. Analysis of endogenous and exogenous alpha oscillations in touch. 

STUDY 2. Relationship between Event Related Potentials (ERPs) and subjects' behavioural outcome.

STUDY 3. Classification of the alpha oscilattions before different attentional scenarios.
